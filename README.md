## HolisticHealthcare
Healthcare Portal for Patients, Organizations and Medical Professionals

This web application made using Flask allows Healthcare providers to view all Patient records and information, getting rid of the need to fax or interchange records between various providers and/or specialities. Healthcare organizations can add/remove members, contact and schedule patients, view/add/delete records. 

Patients are able to see all of their Healthcare providers in one portal, and have access to all prescriptions, records, appointments and are able to communicate with their doctors and providers as well.
